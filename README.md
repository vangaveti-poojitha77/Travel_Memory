                    I. Abstract
                    This project presents the database design of a Travel Memory Management System using
                    MySQL and implemented through Spring Boot. The system is designed to help users store,
                    manage, and retrieve their travel experiences in a structured and efficient manner. It allows
                    users to record important details such as travel locations, dates, budget, distance traveled,
                    photos, favorite food, and personal comments related to their trips.
                    By using a relational database and RESTful APIs, the system ensures efficient data storage,
                    retrieval, and management of travel memories. The Travel Memory Management System
                    serves as a digital travel diary that helps users preserve their travel history, analyze past
                    journeys, and organize their experiences in a user-friendly and scalable manner.
                    II. Introduction
                    Travel plays an important role in personal experiences, and managing travel memories
                    digitally has become increasingly valuable. The Travel Memory Management System is
                    designed to organize and maintain travel-related information for users in a structured
                    database.
                    This system enables users to store detailed records of their trips, including locations visited,
                    travel duration, budget, photos, and special moments. The database design forms the
                    backbone of the system, ensuring data consistency, integrity, and efficient querying.
                    III. Key Features of Travel Memory Management System
                    1. User Registration and Secure Password Storage:
                    The system provides user registration where user passwords are stored in encrypted format.
